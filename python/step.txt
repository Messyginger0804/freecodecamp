Step 17
In Python, an important thing to know is that the same type of quote used to define a string cannot be used inside it. For example, the string 'I'm a string!' is not valid. To use the single quote inside that string you should either:

Escape the quote by prepending a backlash to it: 'I\'m a string!'
Or use double quotes to define the string: "I'm a string!" (preferred).
You can access values in a dictionary through its keys. You need to use bracket notation and include the key between the square brackets:

Example Code
my_dict = {'amount': 50.0, 'category': 'Food'}
my_dict['amount'] # 50.0
You are currently interpolating the expense dictionary in your f-string. Modify the f-string expression to access the value of the 'amount' key and the 'category' key in the expense dictionary.
