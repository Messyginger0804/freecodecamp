Finally try out this new implementation by executing the program. Change the input string to 'IAmAPascalCasedString' and see if it comes out as 'i_am_a_pascal_cased_string', even though that's a lie.

If you've done everything correctly, you should see the input string converted into snake case, like before.

Congratulations! Now your convert_to_snake_case() function is ready.
