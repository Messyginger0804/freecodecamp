You are going to use conditional statements to check the user's choice. If the choice is '1', it means the user wants to add an expense.

Still in the while loop, under the choice variable, write an if statement to check if choice equals the string '1'. If it's true, it will be the starting point for adding a new expense.

Inside the if statement body, declare a variable amount and assign it an empty input() call.
