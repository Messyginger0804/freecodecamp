Step 8
By this point, the variable snake_cased_char_list holds the list of converted characters. To combine these characters into a single string, you can utilize the .join() method.

The join method works by concatenating each element of a list into a string, separated by a designated string, known as the separator.

Example Code
result_string = ''.join(characters)
The example above joins together the elements of the characters list into a single string where each element is concatenated together using an empty string as the separator.

Now, right after the for loop, use the .join() method to join the elements in snake_cased_char_list using an empty string as the separator. Assign the result to a new variable named snake_cased_string.
