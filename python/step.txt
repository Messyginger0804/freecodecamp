Step 4
The raise statement allows you to force a specific exception to occur. It consists of the raise keyword followed by the exception type, and enables you to provide a custom error message:

Example Code
raise ValueError("Invalid value")
When the code above runs, a ValueError is raised and the message "Invalid value" is shown to the user.

If the square_target is less than 0, no real-valued square root can be computed. Therefore, raise a ValueError with the message 'Square root of negative number is not defined in real numbers'. Don't forget to remove the pass keyword.
