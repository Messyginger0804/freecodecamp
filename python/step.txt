Lambda functions are brief, anonymous functions in Python, ideal for simple, one-time tasks. They are defined by the lambda keyword, and they use the following syntax:

Example Code
lambda x: expr
In the example above, x represents a parameter to be used in the expression expr, and it acts just like any parameter in a traditional function. expr is the expression that gets evaluated and returned when the lambda function is called.

Create a variable named test and assign it a lambda function that takes an x parameter and returns x * 2.
