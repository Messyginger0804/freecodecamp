Step 21
Currently, your script throws a TypeError because you are trying to add a string to an integer. You can fix this by converting the digit variable to an integer before adding it to sum_of_odd_digits, using the built-in int function:

Example Code
my_string = '123'
my_int = int(my_string)
Convert the digit variable to an integer before adding it to sum_of_odd_digits. Then, move the print call to the end of the verify_card_number function to print the value of sum_of_odd_digits.
