Step 12
A dictionary is another built-in data type in Python. A dictionary is a collection of data in the form of key-value pairs. Dictionaries are defined with curly braces ({}) and they contain key-value pairs separated by commas. Each key is followed by a colon (:) and the value:

Example Code
{'amount': 50.0, 'category': 'Food'}
In the example above, 'amount' and 'category' are keys, and 50.0 and 'Food' are their corresponding values.

Create a dictionary with a key 'amount' and value of the amount parameter and pass your new dictionary to the .append() call.
