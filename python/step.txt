Step 21
Still, the final result is not exactly what you want to achieve. You need to execute a different expression for the characters filtered out by the if clause. You'll use an else clause for that:

Example Code
spam = [i * 2 if i > 0 else -1 for i in iterable]
Note that, differently from the if clause, the if/else construct must be placed between the expression and the for keyword.

Modify your list comprehension so that when a character is not uppercase it remains unchanged.
