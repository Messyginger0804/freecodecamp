Step 21
Lambda functions can be valuably combined with the map() function, which executes a specified function for each element in a collection of objects, such as a list:

Example Code
map(lambda x: x * 2, [1, 2, 3])
The function to execute is passed as the first argument, and the iterable is passed as the second argument.

The result of the example above would be [2, 4, 6], where each item in the list passed to map() has been doubled by the action of the lambda function.

Modify your print() call to print the result of calling map() with test as the first argument, and [2, 3, 5, 8] as the second argument. You won't be able to see a readable output yet.
