Step 4
Defining the translation does not in itself translate the string. The translate method must be called on the string to be translated with the translation table as an argument:

Example Code
my_string = "tamperlot"
translation_table = str.maketrans({'t': 'c', 'l': 'b'})
translated_string = my_string.translate(translation_table)
Create a variable called translated_card_number and assign it the result of calling the translate method on card_number with card_translation as an argument.
