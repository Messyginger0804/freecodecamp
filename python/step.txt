Step 1
In this project, you are going to build a program that takes a camelCase or PascalCase formatted string as input and converts that to a snake_case formatted string using two approaches. First, you'll use a for loop and then list comprehension to achieve the same results. You'll see how list comprehension can make your code more concise.

Start defining a new function named convert_to_snake_case() that accepts a string named pascal_or_camel_cased_string as input. For now, add a pass statement inside the function.
