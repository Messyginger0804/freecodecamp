Step 1
Before starting with the project, you are going to learn about lists.

Unlike numbers and strings, a list is a data type that works as a container for other values:

Example Code
example_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
empty_list = []
The list is characterized by the square brackets around all the values, and a comma between the values, like: ["A", "happy", "list"]. If the list does not contain any values, then it is an empty list: [].

A list can contain different data types: [1, "Up", ["Down", "Twice"]]. That includes all possible data types. It can also contain another list!

Create a variable called my_list and assign to it an empty list.
