Step 28
Part of the algorithm is to double every second digit, starting from the right. If the result of doubling the number is greater than or equal to 10, add the two digits together. For example, if the digit is 6, double it to get 12. Add 1 and 2 together to get 3. You can do this by using integer division to get the first digit and the modulus operator (%) to get the second digit:

Example Code
my_number = 12
first_digit = my_number // 10
second_digit = my_number % 10
Integer division results in the quotient of the division, rounded down to the nearest integer.

Within the if statement, assign number the result of number // 10 (integer division) plus the modulus of number and 10.
