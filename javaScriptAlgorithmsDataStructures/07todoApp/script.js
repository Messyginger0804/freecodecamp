// Step 1
// In this project, you will learn how localStorage works in JavaScript by building a Todo app. LocalStorage is a web storage feature of JavaScript that lets you persist data by storing the data as a key:value pair.

// The HTML and CSS for this project have been provided for you. Take a look at the files to get yourself familiarized with them.

// Begin by accessing the task-form, confirm-close-dialog, and open-task-form-btn elements with the getElementById() method. Save them in the variables taskForm, confirmCloseDialog, and openTaskFormBtn.

const taskForm = document.getElementById('taskForm');
const confirmCloseDialog = document.getElementById('confirmCloseDialog');
const openTaskFormBtn = document.getElementById('openTaskForm');
