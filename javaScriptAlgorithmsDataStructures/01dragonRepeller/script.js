// The player's inventory in your game will be able to hold multiple items. You will need to use a data type that can do this. An array can be used to hold multiple values. For example:

// let order = ["first", "second", "third"];
// This is an array which holds three values. Notice how the values are separated by commas.

// Change your inventory variable to be an array with the strings stick, dagger, and sword.
