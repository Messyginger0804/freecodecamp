Step 32
button1 is a variable that is not going to be reassigned. If you are not going to assign a new value to a variable, it is best practice to use the const keyword to declare it instead of the let keyword. This will tell JavaScript to throw an error if you accidentally reassign it.

Change your button1 variable to be declared with the const keyword.
