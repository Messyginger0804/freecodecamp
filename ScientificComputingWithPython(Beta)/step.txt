Step 61
Instead of using a loop and a counter variable, you can achieve the same result with a different approach, which you are going to implement in the next few steps.

all() is a built-in Python function that returns True if all the elements inside a given iterable evaluate to True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Replace your existing for loop and two if statements with a single if statement. For the if condition, use a call to the all() function and pass an empty list as the argument to the function call.
