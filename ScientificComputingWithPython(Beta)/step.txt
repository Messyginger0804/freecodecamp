Step 2
You can access the utilities defined inside the imported module through the dot notation. The dot notation works by appending a dot followed by the utility name to the module name. For example, here's how to access the ascii_lowercase constant:

Example Code
import string


print(string.ascii_lowercase)
# Output: abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
In this project, you are going to use different constants from the string module.

Declare a new variable called letters and assign string.ascii_letters to this variable.
